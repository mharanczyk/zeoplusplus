By Maciej Haranczyk, Chris H Rycroft, Richard L Martin, Thomas F Willems

This repository contains a fork of the original zeo++ code (version 0.3.0) with bug fixes and improvements, maintained by the [Laboratory of Molecular Simulation](http://lsmo.epfl.ch/) at EPFL.
For a list of changes, see the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## About

Zeo++ is a software package for high-throughput analysis of structure
and topology of crystalline porous materials. For a given material's
structure, the code calculates the geometrical parameters describing
pores. The tool is based on the Voronoi decomposition, which for
a given arrangement of atoms in a periodic domain provides a graph
representation of the void space. The resulting Voronoi network
is analyzed to obtain the diameter of the largest included sphere
and the largest free sphere, which are two geometrical parameters
that are frequently used to describe pore geometry. Accessibility
of nodes in the network is also determined for a given guest molecule
and the resulting information is later used to retrieve dimensionality
of channel systems as well as in Monte Carlo sampling of accessible
surfaces, volumes and pore size distributions.
The code also offers some aids with structure analysis, e.g. MOF open
metal site detection, and simluations, e.g. generation of blocking spheres.


## Compilation - Linux / Mac OS / Windows with Cygwin

The code is written in ANSI C++, and compiles on many system architectures. The
package contains the C++ source code of Zeo++ as well as Voro++ library.
On Linux, Mac OS, and Windows (using Cygwin), the compilation and installed
can be carried out using GNU Make.

#### Step by step compilation

Clone the git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/lsmo-epfl/zeopp-lsmo
cd zeopp-lsmo
```

Download Eigen library v3.2.7 (if not already installed)
```
wget https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.2.7/eigen-3.2.7.tar.bz2
tar xf eigen-3.2.7.tar.bz2
```

Compile Voro++ library (you may need first to review config.mk file in voro++/ directory; please check Voro++ documentation or
read voro++/README):
```
cd voro++
make
```

Compile Zeo++ code:

```
cd ../zeo++
make
```

This will create `network` binary, the main Zeo++ binary.
Please view the Zeo++ website for instructions, review documentation/README or contact the authors to inquire about otherwise undocumented or custom features.

## Related programs

No external dependencies are required to compile and run the code
(except for the Voro++ library provided with the code), but several
programs may be useful for analyzing the output:

- VMD - molecular visualization package can be used to visualize some of
  characteristics calculated by Zeo++, for example, Voronoi networks,
  Monte Carlo-sampled surface areas and volumes etc. Zeo++ can be called
  from within VMD vis TCl ZeoVis interface (not yet documented, if interested,
  please contact me at mharanczyk@lbl.gov)

- The freeware raytracer POV-Ray (available at www.povray.org) can be used for
  high-quality renderings of the Zeo++/VMD outputs.

- VisIt - powerful visualization package; https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/

I am very interested to hear from users of Zeo++, so if you find this
useful, please email me at mharanczyk@lbl.gov. Also, if you plan to publish an
academic paper using this software, please consider citing the following

The first reference is the main Zeo++ reference describing the idea of
using Voronoi networks in analysis of porous materials. The second reference
describes extensions allowing sampling of structures from a database of
porous materials using divrsity-based selelction.
